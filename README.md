# Personal Finance Manager

A simple, beginner-friendly Python application to manage your personal income and expenses directly from the terminal.

## Features

- Add income with source and optional notes
- Add expenses with reason and optional notes
- View current balance
- View all transaction history (with timestamps)

## Technologies Used

- Python 3 (standard library only, no external packages)
